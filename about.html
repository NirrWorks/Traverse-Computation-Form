            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am Niruta Neupane, a dedicated 4th year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Geomatics Engineering at Kathmandu University. Through this project, I have gained valuable insights into traverse computation and honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This experience has deepened my understanding of geospatial data processing and sparked a strong desire to explore more innovative solutions in the field. I am enthusiastic about applying what I’ve learned to future projects and continuing to grow as a geomatics professional.</p>

            <h3>About the computation form</h3>
            <p>This Traverse Computation Form is an interactive tool designed to assist surveyors and geomatics engineers in computing traverse adjustments and related data. The form includes default values for initial coordinates, observed angles, and station lengths, which can be easily edited by the user. After entering the number of stations and the known bearing, the form dynamically generates input fields for each station. Upon submission, it calculates bearing corrections, coordinate changes (ΔE, ΔN), height differences (Δh), and provides the closing error and linear accuracy, offering a user-friendly way to perform accurate traverse computations.</p>
